Exploratory Data Analyis: After cleaning process we study the descriptive statistics, visualize data based on how they are related to each other.
Model Development: In this vary stage we undergo the use of machine learning algorithm to model.
Evaluation: After model development we check the performance metrics and also checks for the accuracy which produces more accurate results.

# Tools & Technology used:
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Python libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn,

# Conclusion
We have drawn many interesting inferences from the dataset employee_dataset; hereâ€™s a summary of the few of them

1. The ratio of the employees are femal worker are more then male workers
2. The maitial status of the employee are most number of employee are single 132 then married are 122 & divorced 30,seprated 11 and widow 8
